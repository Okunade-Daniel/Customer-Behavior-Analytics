# Customer-Behavior-Analytics

# Introduction
In today's highly competitive retail landscape, understanding customer behavior and product preferences are critical for businesses to thrive and remain profitable. For companies in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, gaining insight into customer purchasing behavior is essential to developing effective strategies that drive sales, revenue growth, and customer satisfaction.

# Objective
The objective of our study is to provide insights into the performance of the company's chips products in the region, understand customer behavior, identify key drivers of sales, evaluate trial and control store performance, and provide data-driven recommendations to inform strategic decision-making and improve sales and customer satisfaction.

# Methodology
To achieve this objective, a comprehensive analysis of the company's sales data, market trends, and customer behavior patterns was conducted. I also evaluated the performance of trial stores versus control stores to determine the effectiveness of key metrics such as total number of customers, total transaction, total sales and average transaction per customer in driving sales.

Furthermore, statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate if the the results from the analysis were statistically significant.

Upon completing this project, actionable insights and recommendations were provided for the company to improve their sales strategy and customer satisfaction and loyalty. I believe that these insights will enable the company to remain competitive in the industry and achieve its long-term growth objectives.
